1. Farnsworth D15 Color Blind Test. D-15 test is a color blindness test that uses a set of colored tiles. When taking the test, people have to arrange these colored tiles in the correct order based on their perception of different colors. Colorblind people will have difficulties in arranging the given colors and make mistakes. Based on these mistakes and the resulting confusion vector(including confusion angle, confusion index, and total error score), the type of color blindness and its severity can be calculated.
